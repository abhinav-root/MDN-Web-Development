<h1>HTML basics</h1>

<p>
    HTMl (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web
    page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of
    paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
</p>

<h2>So What is HTML?</h2>
<p>
    HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML
    consists of series of elements, which you use to enclose or wrap different
    parts of content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The
    enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can
    italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example
    take the following line of content: My cat is very grumpy
</p>
<p>
    If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a
    paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
</p>
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
<h2>Anatomy of an html element</h2>
<img alt="Anatomy of html element"
    src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png" />

<p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
<p>
    1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element(in this case p),
    wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element
    begins or starts to take effect - in this case where the paragraph begins
</p>
<p>
    2. The closing tag: This is the same as opening tag including a forward slash
    before the element name. This states where the element ends. Failing to add a
    closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange
    results.
</p>
<p>
    3. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is
    just text 4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content
    together comprise the element
</p>

<h2>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</h2>
<img alt="image showing html attribute"
    src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" />

<p>
    Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to
    appear in actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is
    the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a
    non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements
    with the same class value) with style information and other things. Some
    attributes have no value, such as required
</p>

<p>Attributes that set a value always have:</p>
<p>
    1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the
    element already has one or more attributes)
</p>
<p>2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign</p>
<p>3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks</p>
<h2>Nesting elemnts</h2>
<p>
    You can put elements inside other elements too â€” this is called nesting. If we
    wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in
    a strong element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
</p>
<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy</p>

<h2>Void elements</h2>
<p>
    Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the img
    element that we already have in our html page
</p>
<h2>Anatomy of an HTML document</h2>
<p>
    DOCTYPE html: It is a required preamble. It don't do much but just needed to
    make sure you document behaves correctly
</p>
<p>
    html: This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes
    known as root element . It also includes lang attribute, setting the primary
    language of the document
</p>
<p>
    head: This element acts as container for all the stuff you want to include in
    your html page that isn't the content that you're showing to viewers. This
    includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear
    in search results, CSS to style out content, character set decarations and
    more
</p>
<p>
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;: This element sets the character set. Your
    document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast
    majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual
    content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set it and can avoid
    problems later
</p>
<p>
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;: The viewport
    element ensure the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile
    browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them
    down
</p>
<p>
    title: This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in
    the browser tab the page is loaded in It is also used to describe the page
    when you bookmark/favorite it
</p>
<p>
    body: This contains all the content that you want to show to users when they
    visit your page, whether that's text images, videos, games, playable audio
    tracks or whatever
</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>
    img element embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does
    via src attribute, which contains the path to our image
</p>
<p>In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of following
    reasons:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impariments often use tools called screen readers
        to read out the alt text to them
    </li>
    <li>
        Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, if the path inside src attribute is
        incorrect.
        The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image
        conveys
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Marking up text</h2>
<h3>Headings</h3>
<p>Heading element allows you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings - or subheadings</p>
<p>In the same way book has main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too</p>
<p>HTML contains 6 heading levels, h1-h6 although you will commonly use 3 - 4 most</p>
<!-- 4 headings level -->
<h1>My main title</h1>
<h2>My top level heading</h2>
<h3>My subheading</h3>
<h4>My sub-subheading</h4>
<p>Note: Anything in HTML between <!-- and --> is an HTML comment. The browser ignores comments as it renders the code.
    In other words, they are not visible on the page - just in the code. HTML comments are a way for you to write
    helpful notes about your code or logic.</p>
<p>You'll see that your heading level 1 has an implicit style. Don't use heading elements to make text bigger or bold,
    because they are used for accessibility and other reasons such as SEO. Try to create a meaningful sequence of
    headings on your pages, without skipping levels.</p>
<h2>Paragraphs</h2>
<p>p elements are for containig paragraphs of text. You'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content</p>
<p>This is a single paragraph</p>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>A lots of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of
    at least 2 elements. The most common list type are ordered and unordered lists
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Unordered lists are for lists where the order of items doesn't matter, such as shopping list. These are wrapped
        in a ul element</li>
    <li>
        Ordered lists are for lists where the order of elements does matter, such as recipe. These are wrapped in ol
        element
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Each item inside the list is put inside an li element</p>
<p>For example</p>
<p>At mozilla, we're global community of</p>
<ul>
    <li>technologists</li>
    <li>thinkers</li>
    <li>builders</li>
</ul>
<p>working together</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Links are very important - they are what makes the web a web. To add a link, we need to use a simple element
    &lt;a&gt; - "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these
    steps
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Choose some text</li>
    <li>Wrap the text in &lt;a&gt; element</li>
    <li>Give the &lt;a&gt; element an href attribute</li>
    <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want to link to</li>
</ol>
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>
<p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the beginning of
    the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.</p>
<p>Note: href might appear like a rather obscure choice for an attribute name at first. If you are having trouble
    remembering it, remember that it stands for hypertext reference.</p>
