What tools do i actually need right now?

1. Installing a text editor
    For web development we recommend starting with visual code (much better than notepad).
    It is a free editor, that offers live previews and code hints.

2. Installing modern web browsers
    Google Chrome

3. Installing a local web server
    Some example will need to be run by web server to work properly

What tools do the professionals user?
    * A computer
    * A text editor. Visual Studio Code is a very good choice
    * Web browsers to test code. Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari are most-used browsers.
    * A graphic editor, like GIMP, Figma, Photoshop, Sketch or XD to make images or graphics for your web pages
    * A version control system, to manage files on servers, collaborate on a project with team, share code and
        assets and avoid editing conflicts. Right now Git is the most popular version control system along with
        GitHub or GitLab hosting service.
    * An FTP program, used on older web hosting programs to manage files on servers (Git is increasingly replacing
        FTP for this purpose). There are loads of FTP programs available including Cyberduck, Fetch and Filezilla.
    * An automation  system, like Webpack, Grunt or Gulp to automatically perform repetitive tasks, such as minifying
        code and running tests.
    * Libraries, frameworks etc. to speed up writing common functionality. A library tends to be an existing JS or CSS
        file that provides ready rolled functionality for you to make use of in your code. A framework tends to take
        this idea further, offering a complete system with custom syntaxes for you to write a web app on top of.
